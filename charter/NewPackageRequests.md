# New Big Bang Packages

This is the process for adding an package into Big Bang

## Incubation

To get into an incubation stage, an package needs the following:

* Written support by **two** Big Bang Customers identifying capability gap in BigBang
* Nomination of **two** developers from different companies, who have contributed to other big bang packages, as Package Owners.
* Architecture Review approved by a majority of the present Big Bang Package Owners.
* Sign-off by Government

## Full Membership

Once the package adheres to all [Package Requirements](Package Requirements.md), a final review of implementation details will be presented to the Big Bang Admins.
